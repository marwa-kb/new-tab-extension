* This extension appears when opening a new tab.
* The background image is obtained thanks to the **Unsplash API**. A new background image can be generated by double-clicking anywhere on the page or by pressing (r).
* It's also possible to change the theme of the generated images.
* The fullscreen mode can be toggled by pressing (f).
* The extension gets the localisation of the user and then shows the corresponding weather thanks to the **OpenWeather API**.
* It also shows the current time and date.
* To do: implement possibility to keep image (done ✅)  

-----------------------
This is not my first JS project but it's the first one I actually use in my everyday life.
This is also one of the first projects that made me learn how to interact with APIs.  


Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
